    "1. Types of Data\n",
    "Ans. Data can be classified into qualitative and quantitative:\n",
    "\n",
    "Qualitative (Categorical) Data: Describes qualities or characteristics.\n",
    "Nominal Scale: Categories without a specific order (e.g., colors: red, blue, green).\n",
    "Ordinal Scale: Categories with a meaningful order but without consistent intervals (e.g., customer satisfaction: poor, average, good).\n",
    "Quantitative (Numerical) Data: Represents numerical values.\n",
    "Interval Scale: Has ordered values with equal intervals but no true zero (e.g., temperature in Celsius).\n",
    "Ratio Scale: Has ordered values, equal intervals, and a true zero (e.g., height, weight).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Measures of Central Tendency\n",
    "Ans. Mean: The average of all values. Used when data has no extreme outliers.\n",
    "Median: The middle value when data is sorted. Used for skewed distributions.\n",
    "Mode: The most frequently occurring value. Used for categorical data.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: Average test score in a class.\n",
    "Median: Middle income level in a dataset with extreme high and low salaries.\n",
    "Mode: Most common shoe size sold in a store.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Concept of Dispersion\n",
    "Ans. Dispersion refers to how spread out the data is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance: Measures the average squared deviation from the mean.\n",
    "Standard Deviation: The square root of variance, representing data spread in original units.\n",
    "A low standard deviation indicates data points are close to the mean, while a high standard deviation means they are spread out.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Box Plot and Interpretation\n",
    "Ans. A box plot (or box-and-whisker plot) visualizes data distribution:\n",
    "Box: Represents the interquartile range (IQR, Q1 to Q3).\n",
    "Line inside box: Median.\n",
    "Whiskers: Minimum and maximum values within 1.5 * IQR.\n",
    "Outliers: Individual points beyond the whiskers.\n",
    "It helps identify skewness, spread, and outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Role of Random Sampling\n",
    "Ans- Random sampling ensures unbiased representation of a population in statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple Random Sampling: Every member has an equal chance of selection.\n",
    "Stratified Sampling: Population is divided into subgroups before sampling.\n",
    "Systematic Sampling: Selecting every nth member from a list.\n",
    "It helps make accurate inferences about populations from a small sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Skewness and Its Types\n",
    "Ans- Skewness measures data asymmetry:\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive Skew (Right-skewed): Tail on the right; mean > median (e.g., income distribution).\n",
    "Negative Skew (Left-skewed): Tail on the left; mean < median (e.g., exam scores).\n",
    "Zero Skew: Symmetrical distribution (e.g., normal distribution).\n",
    "Skewness affects interpretation by shifting measures of central tendency.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Interquartile Range (IQR) and Outliers\n",
    "Ans- IQR = Q3 - Q1 (difference between third and first quartiles).\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers are identified as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Below Q1 - 1.5 * IQR.\n",
    "Above Q3 + 1.5 * IQR.\n",
    "IQR is useful for detecting extreme values without being affected by skewness.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Binomial Distribution Conditions\n",
    "Ans - A binomial distribution applies when:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each trial has two possible outcomes (success/failure).\n",
    "The probability of success remains constant.\n",
    "Each trial is independent.\n",
    "There is a fixed number of trials (n).\n",
    "Example: Tossing a coin 10 times and counting heads follows a binomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Normal Distribution and Empirical Rule\n",
    "Ans - Properties of Normal Distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bell-shaped, symmetrical around the mean.\n",
    "Mean = Median = Mode.\n",
    "Defined by mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ).\n",
    "Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7 Rule):\n",
    "\n",
    "68% of data lies within 1σ from the mean.\n",
    "95% lies within 2σ.\n",
    "99.7% lies within 3σ.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Poisson Process and Example\n",
    "Ans - A Poisson process models the probability of a fixed number of events occurring in a given time/space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: The number of customer calls received per hour at a call center.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Random Variables: Discrete vs. Continuous\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - A random variable is a variable whose values depend on the outcome of a random phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete Random Variable: Takes countable values (e.g., number of students in a class).\n",
    "Continuous Random Variable: Takes infinite values within a range (e.g., height of students).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Example Dataset: Covariance & Correlation\n",
    "Ans - import numpy as np\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example Dataset: Study hours vs. Exam Scores\n",
    "data = {\n",
    "    'Study_Hours': [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11],\n",
    "    'Exam_Scores': [60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 92, 95, 98]\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate Covariance\n",
    "covariance = df['Study_Hours'].cov(df['Exam_Scores'])\n",
    "print(f\"Covariance between Study Hours and Exam Scores: {covariance}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate Correlation (Pearson's r)\n",
    "correlation = df['Study_Hours'].corr(df['Exam_Scores'])\n",
    "print(f\"Correlation between Study Hours and Exam Scores: {correlation}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Covariance Interpretation:\n",
    "# The covariance is approximately 28.33. This positive value indicates that as study hours increase, exam scores tend to increase as well.\n",
    "However, the magnitude of 28.33 doesn't have a clear, standardized meaning on its own. \n",
    "It depends on the units of the variables (hours and score points).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Correlation Interpretation:\n",
    "# The correlation is approximately 0.998. This value is very close to 1, indicating a very strong positive linear relationship between study hours and exam scores. This means that there's a nearly perfect linear trend where more study hours are associated with higher exam scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Further Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "# - The high positive correlation suggests that study hours are a strong predictor of exam scores in this dataset.\n",
    "# - The data points closely follow a straight line when plotted (if you were to create a scatter plot).\n",
    "# - It's important to remember that correlation does not imply causation. While study hours and exam scores are strongly correlated, this doesn't definitively prove that more study hours *cause* higher exam scores. Other factors could also influence exam performance.\n",
    "# - The high correlation value suggests that linear regression would be very effective at predicting exam scores based on study hours, for this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation of the Dataset and Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset: We have a simple dataset representing the relationship between the number of hours students studied and their corresponding exam scores.\n",
    "Covariance: The calculated covariance is a positive value, indicating a positive relationship. However, the magnitude is hard to interpret without context.\n",
    "Correlation: The correlation coefficient is very close to 1, indicating a strong positive linear relationship. This means that as study hours increase, exam scores almost perfectly increase in a linear fashion.\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "The strong positive correlation provides evidence that studying more tends to lead to higher exam scores.\n",
    "It is important to remember that correlation does not equal causation.\n",
    "This dataset would lend itself very well to linear regression modeling."
